#### Motivation:
This is my 5th Hackintosh built and i must say that this one is best of them . It took about a month and at some point (due to trackpad issue(Polling and Gpio pinning)) i want to quit it but Thanks to @Edio and @Waqas Umer for motivation and now everything work smoothly with great battery life. Performance is some how  on par with with 2019 MacBook Pro 13 inch .
